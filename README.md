We have made a N-Gram Model with three options to select for the users : Bigram, trigram and fourgram. The user enters the starting words, and the predicted sentence is displayed along with metrics like perplexity, fluency and coherence. Users also have the option to select the number of sentences to be generated and the length of the sentences can also be selected by the user.
